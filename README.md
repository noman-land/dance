## Deployment

1. Make sure to set a shell variable for `$PICO8_PATH`. On a Mac, something similar to the following can be added to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` or whatever shell you use.

    ```bash
    export PICO8_PATH="/Applications/pico-8/PICO-8.app/Contents/MacOS/pico8"
    ```

1. Run `npm run export`.

1. Push to Github.
